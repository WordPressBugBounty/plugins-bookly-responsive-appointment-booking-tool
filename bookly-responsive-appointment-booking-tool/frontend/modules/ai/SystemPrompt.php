     * What Bookly Cloud puts into the prompt as the business's own section. Cloud's prompt
     * is one text for every site - the agent's rules and the concepts of booking, each saying
     * when it applies - so a change to it reaches every site without a plugin release. The
     * plugin sends only what is particular to this business:
     *
     *  - about, assistant, customer_info: what the owner wrote on this widget's appearance -
     *    about the business; how the assistant should present itself; what customers
     *    should know. Separate fields, so each goes into the prompt with its own weight:
     *    facts, wishes about tone, information to pass on;
     *  - company: name and contacts from Settings > Company, so the assistant can give
     *    them whenever it suggests contacting the business;
     *  - facts: how the business is set up, as values grouped by what the customer sees -
     *    Cloud picks the parts of its prompt by them (Concepts::facts());
     *  - catalog: services, staff members, locations (Catalog::payload()).
     *
     * The owner's texts stay per-form (a site can publish several assistants, e.g. one per
     * location) and the token travels with the request instead of being stored on the
     * conversation - see Ajax::aiSendMessage()/spawnWorker().
     *
     * Everything here has to stay stable for the whole conversation: Bookly
     * Cloud marks the end of the system prompt as a prompt-cache breakpoint,
     * so any value that changes between two calls (a clock, above all) would
     * invalidate the cached prefix on every single request and quietly turn a
     * ~10% cache read back into a full-price charge. The current time is
     * therefore attached to the customer's message instead - see
     * ::dateLine() and Ajax::buildCompletionPayload().
     *
